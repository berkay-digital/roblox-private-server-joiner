# Roblox Private Server Joiner

A simple AutoHotkey script that keeps you connected to a Roblox private server. If your game crashes or you get disconnected, it'll automatically relaunch the game for you.

## How to use
1. Download the executable: https://haze.wtf/Roblox%20PS%20Joiner.exe
3. Paste your Private Server link into the box.
4. (Optional) Select your Roblox folder if it's not in the default location.
5. Click **START MONITOR**.

## Note
I only tested this with normal Roblox so i dont know if this works with 3rd party launchers. Also i suggest using it with one roblox instance.
